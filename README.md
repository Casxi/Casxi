### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Having backgrounds in both software and electrical engineering, I've made use of my code in many different sub-fields and aspects.
I'm not just a programmer though! I also enjoy photography, travel, Chinese calligraphy, painting, and playing video games :) Being able to use my creativity from other places has shown me creative approaches of designing and approaching problems, in order to think outside of the box.
